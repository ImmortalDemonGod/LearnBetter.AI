- Code Structure 
    - Split the code into modules with these high-level dependencies:
        - main.py - CLI parsing -> chatbot.py -> gpt.py - GPT-3 API calls -> brains.py - Brain subclasses -> logger.py
            - main.py: Handles CLI arguments and initiates the chatbot.
            - chatbot.py: Defines the Chatbot class that manages the conversation flow.
            - gpt.py: Provides a wrapper for GPT-3 API calls.
            - brains.py: Contains Brain subclasses, each responsible for different capabilities.
            - logger.py: Implements the Logger class to save conversation history.
- Object-Oriented Design
    - Chatbot Class
        - class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self, brains, logger):
        """Constructor initializes brains and logger"""
        
    def send_message(self, message):
        """Send user message, call API, return response"""
        
    def select_brain(self, message):
        """Choose the most appropriate brain for the message"""
        - 
    - Brain Class
        - class Brain:
    def __init__(self, name, personality):
        """Constructor initializes state"""
        
    def generate_response(self, message):
        """Generate a text response to the message"""
- Input Validation
    - Ensure function arguments are validated using pydantic:
    - from pydantic import BaseModel
  
class Message(BaseModel):
      content: str
  
def process(msg: Message):
      # Function logic
- Token Budgeting 
    - Set the per-turn token budget limit to 4000.
    - Utilize summarization when the token limit is reached.
    - Optionally, consider mentioning response filtering to reduce inappropriate/unhelpful responses.
- Testing
    - Implement unit tests for critical functions.
    - Mock GPT-3 API calls for efficient testing.
    - Conduct end-to-end tests to cover full conversation flows.
- Instrumentation
    - Log API errors along with tracebacks.
    - Implement a mechanism to send logs to a centralized system for better monitoring.
- Best Practices
    - Adopt descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions.
    - Follow PEP8 style guidelines for consistent code formatting.
    - Promote modularization by creating simple, single-purpose functions.
    - Include suggestions for using immutable data structures and linting/formatting tools.
- Documentation
    - Document the system's architecture and the responsibilities of each module.
    - Provide clear usage instructions in the README for developers and users.
- Additional Adjustments 
    - Emphasize the importance of unit tests covering core logic and end-to-end tests validating full conversation flows.
    - Include suggestions for using immutable data structures and linting/formatting tools in the best practices section.
    - Explicitly state that the final code version should be designed to avoid global state and mutable data.
    - Consider including a brief mention of response filtering in the token budgeting section without making it a strict requirement.
